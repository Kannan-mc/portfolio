                <h3>Mechanical Engineer</h3>
                <p>Embarking on my maritime journey with Anglo Eastern Ship Management in 2011 following the 
                    completion of my Postgraduate Diploma in Marine Engineering, I commenced as an Engine Cadet. 
                    Over the years, I traversed the seas aboard various foreign-going vessels, including containers, Chemical Tankers, 
                    and VLCCs, steadily progressing to the esteemed position of Engineering Officer on Watch.</p>

                    <p>In 2016, I transitioned to British Petroleum (BP), where I gained invaluable exposure 
                    beyond operational and maintenance realms. One standout experience at BP was participating in the 
                    delivery of new builds from Hyundai Yard, South Koreaâ€”a journey that underscored the complexities of 
                    transforming a vessel from yard to sea-going state. Challenges ranged from technical hurdles to establishing a 
                    new ISO system for vessels, enriching my expertise and broadening my horizons...</p>

                    <p>Setting sail with Anglo Eastern Ship Management in 2011 after earning my Marine Engineering Post graduate diploma, 
                        I began as an Engine Cadet. Navigating various vessels from Containers, Chemical Tankers, and VLCCs I climbed to 
                        Engineering Officer on Watch. Transitioning to British Petroleum in 2016, I embarked on new challenges, 
                        including wrangling new builds from Hyundai Yard and Dry Docking in China Yards.
                         From mastering ISO systems to riding the waves of hilarity, my journey's been quite the adventure.......</p>

                    <p>Moving forward i joined AL-Bahar(Caterpillar) as Commissioning and Application Engineer. It really expanded my horizon of thinking.
                         I started to acknowledge the financial facts and business aspect of the projects not only the technical aspects. 
                         This position enabled me to dive into instrumentation control and electronics part of the machinery. 
                         Doing application and technical complaince, lead to understanding of the market and needs of the customer.
